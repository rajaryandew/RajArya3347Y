### 🚀 About Me

- 🧑‍💻 Full-stack dev in the making — I build end-to-end apps from scratch
- 📚 I don’t copy tutorials — I use docs and build my own way
- 🧠 I go deep instead of rushing — understanding > speed
- ⚡ I care about simplicity, speed, and dev experience (DX)
- 🧩 I enjoy both building projects and solving DSA problems

---

### 🔭 What I'm Up To

- Building full-stack apps with **Next.js** and **PostgreSQL**
- Exploring clean architecture and better dev workflows
- Creating projects that are actually fun to use and work on

### 🧘 My Dev Vibes

> “Build what feels right. Learn slow. Code clean.”

Not grinding for hype — just making cool stuff, one line at a time.
