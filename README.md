### 🚀 About Me
- 🧑‍💻 Full-stack dev in the making — I build apps end-to-end from scratch  
- 📖 Docs over tutorials — I figure things out my own way  
- 🧠 Depth > speed — I’d rather *understand* than rush  
- ⚡ I care about clean code, simplicity, and great DX  
- 🎯 I balance fun project builds with DSA problem solving  

---

### 🔭 What I'm Up To
- Building full-stack apps with **Next.js**, **PostgreSQL**, and modern tools  
- Learning clean architecture and better dev workflows  
- Making projects that are actually fun to use and work on  
- Staying consistent, not grinding for hype

### 🧘 My Dev Vibes
> “Build what feels right. Learn slow. Code clean.”  
> Not chasing clout — just doing my thing, one line at a time.
